# Azul-Project
As part of a school project, my classmate and I made a digital version of the Azul board game entirely coded in Python.

# How to run the program 
To play the game, run the "Fonctions_Actualisation" file. You will be greated by a menu. Clic on the first button to start a new game or on the second one to continue a previous game.
When you start a game, you need to write the name of the wall you want to play on in the terminal. The available names are the ones of the txt files (ex. "MatriceC.txt").
